<div class="textblock"><p>In the scope of crash report analysis process, we may imagine the following roles for CrashFix users:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Administrator (project manager) typically adds users to project and controls what they do. The manager may want to get regular statistics reports to see how many crash reports have been received and how many bugs have been fixed.  </li>
<li>
Developers typically may want to upload debugging symbols, browse incoming crash reports and collections, and open bugs. The developers are the only people who can do this (QA can not), because the developers are the only people who understand the client application's code. Developers then try to fix open bugs and change bug status appropriately.  </li>
<li>
Quality assurance engineers (QA) typically have no idea how the code works, so they can not open new bugs (developers will do that). But, QA can try to reproduce a bug on their machine and, if the bug can be reproduced, verify that the bug has been fixed by a developer.  </li>
<li>
Guests (or limited users) are the people who may want to browse crash reports, crash groups and bugs (but not to make any changes).  <br  />
 </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_groups"></a>
User Groups</h1>
<p>Each CrashFix user belongs to certain user group. There are four standard groups: Admin (Administrators), Dev (Developers), QA (Quality Assurance) and Guest (Limited Users). <br  />
 These standard groups represent typical roles in a software project. <br  />
</p>
<p>To manage user groups you need to log in under the root user or under another user having permission to access Administer panel. After you have logged in, click the <em>Administer</em> button on the Main menu. Administer panel appears. Click the <em>Groups</em> item on the top menu. The standard user groups appear (shown in the figure below).</p>

<div class="caption">
Admin groups</div></div>
<p>Standard groups can be modified and new groups can be created on demand.</p>
<p>A group can be disabled. Users belonging a disabled group can not log into the web application.</p>
<p>Each user belonging certain group is assigned some permissions. For example, to see what permissions are set for the Admin group, click the group name. The group details page appears (shown in the figure below).</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="admin_groups_admin.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Admin groups admin</div></div>
<p>As we can see, the root user has all permissions, including the permission to access Administer panel.</p>
<p>Along with permissions, custom UI preferences may be set for all users in the group. For example, a developer (Dev) user may want to see open bugs assigned to him, while a quality assurance engineer (QA) may want to see bugs ready for verification. This preference is controlled by the <em>Default Bug Status Filter</em> option on the group details page.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="users"></a>
Users</h1>
<p>To manage users you need to log in under the root user or another user having permission to access Administer panel.</p>
<p>After you have logged in, click the <em>Administer</em> button on the Main menu. Admin panel appears (shown in the figure below).</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="admin_users.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Admin users</div></div>
<p>By default, there is the root user only. You may want to add more users. In order to do this, click the <em>Add New User</em> button. The <em>Add New User</em> page appears (shown in the figure below).</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="admin_add_new_user.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Add new user</div></div>
<p>In the appeared form, enter new user name, choose what group the user should belong and enter user's E-mail address. Then press the <em>Create</em> button. <br  />
</p>
<p>Next, an E-mail message is sent to user's E-mail address you have entered. The E-mail message contains account activation link. The new user should open the link in his browser for the first login and password change.</p>
