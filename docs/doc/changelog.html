<div class="textblock"><h4>CrashFix v.1.0.4. Release date: 29 March 2013.</h4>
<ul class="changelog-list">
<li>
New: Added an ability to define custom crash report collection names. Typically, a collection name is generated automatically based on stack trace information, but now a client application may define custom collection name by specifying custom property named 'CollectionId'. <br  />
  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: Ability to relax exact build age match requirement. If this option is enabled, CrashFix loads the symbol file even if its build age doesn't match exactly. This option is disabled by default, and is activated by unsetting the 'Require exact build age when loading debugging symbols' check box on Administer-&gt;Projects-&gt;ProjectName page.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: improved default search filter on Collections page. Now the filter displays nonempty collections with bugs unassigned or open, hiding all empty collections.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: added Distinct IPs column for Collections page. The column can be used to see how many different IP addresses have contributed into the certain collection, allowing to concentrate on the most widespread collections.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: added 'Reprocess All Reports' and 'Reprocess Selected Reports' buttons to Crash Reports page. This make it possible to process multiple crash reports at the same time, if desired.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: closed bug details header is now displayed using gray color making it easier to visually determine if the bug is closed or not.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: CrashFix service (Windows version) now supports crash reporting. If the service crashes, it will write a crash report to <em>crash_reports</em> subdirectory of service's installation directory (typically to <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\CrashFix\crash_reports</em>).  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
Fix: CrashFix service crashes when processing a stack trace having very long symbol names.  </li>
<li>
Fix: Too small font and possible PHP error in OS version distribution widget on Digest page when there are many OS versions available.  </li>
<li>
Fix: PHP error in Debug Info Uploads widget on Digest page when there are many symbol files uploaded.  </li>
<li>
Fix: PHP errors in CrashFix web application if installing it to a system having PHP 5.4.  </li>
<li>
Fix: Debug info uploader tool could by mistake include folder names to the list of symbol files for upload.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>CrashFix v.1.0.3. Release date: 8 February 2013.</h4>
<ul class="changelog-list">
<li>
New: improved the usability of menu on top of crash report view (Summary, Files, Screenshots, ...). Now certain menu item is grayed if crash report does not contain data of such type. For example, Screenshots item is displayed in gray if there are no screenshot files in crash report.  </li>
<li>
New: added Videos tab on crash report view page. This allows user to browse video files if they are contained in error report.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: improved CrashFix uploader's &ndash;help command (added usage examples); added new option -v (verbose output).  </li>
<li>
New: added 'PDB GUID+Age' column for Modules tab of a crash report view. This may help when its needed to match a module with a symbol file.  </li>
<li>
New: improved layout of Digest page widgets (more space for geo location distribution widget, OS version distribution widget and crash report version distribution widget).  </li>
<li>
New: old temporary files that were not removed from <em>/protected/runtime/</em> directory for some reason are now cleaned automatically.  </li>
<li>
Fix: temporary files are not removed by CrashFix service when processing minidumps from crash reports.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
Fix: crash reports having no minidump file or having no exception information inside of the minidump file are treated as Invalid. Now they are put inside of 'Reports without Exception Info' collection.  </li>
<li>
Fix: the list of projects in drop list on the Digest page is not sorted. Now it is sorted alphabetically.  </li>
<li>
Fix: at page Home -&gt; Crash Reports, clicking the Upload New File link results in PHP error.  </li>
<li>
Fix: in crash report Summary view, OS bitness is always 64-bit, even if the OS is actually 32-bit.  </li>
<li>
Fix: if daemon crashes when processing crash report, crash report view has empty error message.  </li>
<li>
Fix: when processing crash report stack trace, module names are assigned to stack frames incorrectly; that can cause incorrect behavior and PHP errors.  </li>
<li>
Fix: setting zero as project's disk quota causes PHP error (divizion by zero). Now zero quotas are also allowed (setting zero as disk quota now means unlimited disk usage).  </li>
<li>
Fix: PDB not found problem if first processing a crash report, then upload PDB file for that crash report and then process the crash report again.  </li>
<li>
Fix: cannot remove debug info files from disk when they are locked by daemon's cache.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>CrashFix v.1.0.2. Release date: 12 December 2012.</h4>
<ul class="changelog-list">
<li>
New: improved stability and memory consumption of CrashFix service on large symbol files.  </li>
<li>
New: updated <em>crashfixd.conf</em> file and added new parameters <em>MAX_THREAD_COUNT</em> (defines count of worker threads), <em>MAX_DEBUG_INFO_CACHE_SIZE</em> (defines count of symbols files that can be stored in cache), <em>MAX_MEM_USAGE_MB</em> (defines maximum memory usage for the service).  </li>
<li>
New: an ability to temporarily lock batch import of crash reports and debug info files by placing the <em>importlock</em> file to the <em>WEB_ROOT%/crashfix/protected/import</em> directory  </li>
<li>
Fix: error 'You are not allowed to perform this action' when several users try to access CrashFix web application at the same time.  </li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Fix: incorrect display of statistics widgets on Digest page when uploading many (several hundreds) crash reports at once. </p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>CrashFix v.1.0.1. Release date: 20 November 2012.</h4>
<ul class="changelog-list">
<li>
New: wide layout for CrashFix web application. Now the layout is optimized for wide displays.  </li>
<li>
New: added new types of statistics widgets for Digest page: geographic locations distribution, operating system versions distribution, bug statuses distribution.  </li>
<li>
New: added Mail tab to Administer panel. Now administrator can browse E-mail messages sent recently.  </li>
<li>
New: added an ability to perform batch import of crash report files and symbols from a directory. This allows, for example, to upload crash reports to a web server, copy the uploaded files to another machine over SSH and import the files to the CrashFix server installed on that machine, not exposing CrashFix web interface to outside world.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: added an ability to dump verbose error information to screen by defining <em>CRASHFIX_WEBAPP_DEBUG</em> environment variable. If an error happens and if this variable is defined, CrashFix web application generates verbose information about errors and dumps it to browser window; otherwise a short error message is printed. It is not recommended to define this variable in production system.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
New: better diagnostics of invalid CrashFix service configuration. On user log in, a popup window appears if there are some service configuration errors, allowing administrator to diagnose and fix the problem.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
Fix: can not change bug status alone (not changing other fields).  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
Fix: when processing a crash report CrashFix web application complains about the e-mail address while it is a valid one.  </li>
<li>
Fix: can not upload symbol files larger than 50 MB.  <br  />
 </li>
<li>
Fix: removed some junk messages from CrashFix service's log level 0.  </li>
